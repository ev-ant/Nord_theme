# Nord_theme
Theme for `beamer` presentation, based on corporate colors and requirements

## About

This is a theme for the presentation in `beamer`- class in \LaTeX, created, based on the graphical profile of Nord University (<http://www.nord.no>).

It is based on corporate colors, shapes and includes university's logo and title page background, suggested for the PowerPoint presentation template.

## Before use

You need to download (at least) two files:

- `beamerthemenord.sty`
- *images* folder.

### If you have installed LaTeX

Assuming, that you use Windows OS:

1. in directory *C:/* create a following tree: `C:/.../localtexmf/tex/latex`

2. place downloaded files into newly created *latex*-folder ;

3. open **MiKTeX Settings** program
    1. go to *Roots* and add a path to *localtexmf* folder here.
    2. *Apply* changes.
    
Now you ready to use the custom theme in any newly created `beamer`-presentation.

### If you prefer to use online-editor:

Be sure, that all presentations are created in the folder, which contains downloaded files.

## To use

If you want to use this theme, in the preamble of the `beamer`-presentation add

`\usetheme{nord}` 

after `\documentclass{beamer}`.

Alternatively, you can copy `template.tex` file and modify it according to your needs.

Some basic guidance how to create presentation, using this theme is given in `template.tex`

If you want to use it for the Rmarkdown, specify `beamer_presentation` output with `theme: nord`
